# Sprint 2 - *T14* - *Team XIV*

## Goal

### A shorter trip with a better itinerary.

## Definition of Done

* Ready for the demo.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and a JAR file containing the executables to be used for the demo. 
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.
* No outstanding branches, commits, pull requests.

## Policies

* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* Tests are written before/with code.  
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the affected code.

## Plan 

User stories (epics) in the Sprint Backlog: *#57, #58, #59, #60*.

Total planned tasks *10* / issues in the Sprint Backlog: *10*

## Review

#### Completed user stories (epics) in Sprint Backlog 
* *#57*
* *#58*
* *#60*
Completed *10* tasks / issues associated with these user stories.

#### Incomplete user stories / epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *#59*

#### What went well
* *Overall there was good progress, SVG map, cumulative distance now works, Updates to user GUI, communication/teamwork*

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* *Calculating the nearest neighbor/shortest distance remains unfinished, learning REACT Framework, Learning how to make an SVG.  Resolutions - pushed Shortest distance to next spring, research on both REACT and SVG files*

## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
**Teamwork** | Communication, worked through issues well together for having 3 members | Examine where we're at and our performance more often | Schedule weekly meetings to touch base, help each other out and compare code
**Process** | Determined roles well, divided work | Starting sooner so we're not pushing to the last minute, more test cases | Do better with sticking with what is decided in the Daily Scrum meetings
**Tools** | Learned SVG and REACT | Become more familiar with npm, use Scrum more effectively | Have everyone run the program more often with npm.
