# Sprint 3 - *T14* - *Team XIV*

## Goal

### A web based solution with shorter trips and a large data source.

## Definition of Done

* Ready for the demo.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v3.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and an executable JAR file for the demo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>3.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.
* 

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

What we will change this time | Learned SVG and REACT | Become more familiar with npm, use Scrum more effectively | Have everyone run the program more often with npm.
What we did well | Worked well the last few days to put all our code together | Followed Xenhub better (burndown and boards) | Got more use to maven and intellij
What we need to work on | Hold each other accountable for starting earlier | Follow Xenhub burndown ideal path more closely | Write more JUnit tests
What we will change next time | Hold each other accountable for starting on time | Use Xenhub burndown chart and boards more effectively | Write better test cases
