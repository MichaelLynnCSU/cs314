# Sprint 2 - *T30* - *Consilium*

## Goal

### A shorter trip with a better itinerary.

## Definition of Done

* Ready for the demo.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and a JAR file containing the executables to be used for the demo. 
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.
* No outstanding branches, commits, pull requests.

## Policies

* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* Tests are written before/with code.  
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All pull requests include tests for the affected code.

## Plan 

User stories (epics) in the Sprint Backlog: *#80, #81, #82, #83, #84, #85*.  

Total planned tasks / issues in the Sprint Backlog: *9* 

## Daily Scrums

Date | Tasks done this time | Tasks done next time | Impediments | Confidence

## Retrospective

# T30 Retrospective for Sprint 2

Area | What we did well | What we need to work on | What we will change
:--- | :------- | :--------- | :---------------------
**Teamwork** | We mostly got our parts done. People stepped in the fill in gaps when stuff wasn't complete. | We need to meet more often and communicate more. | We will communicate more using Slack/Discord, not just create github issues.
**Process** | We got everything done! Except buttons, I guess. | We need to work on making sure that things are working at every intermediate step and ensuring that everybody is familiar with every part of the code. | We need to do more, smaller commits to reduce conflict and ensure that things are working at every step.
**Tools** | We effectively used unit testing, maven, and some external libraries. | We need to refactor our code and make it a lot more readable by dividing into class files, removing unnecesarry comments, and fixing indentation. | We'll be more consistent with the way we organize our program.
