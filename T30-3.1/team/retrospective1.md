# T30 Retrospective for Sprint 1

Area | What we did well | What we need to work on | What we will change
:--- | :------- | :--------- | :---------------------
**Teamwork** | There wasn't much teamwork in for this sprint, however we did do a good job of helping each other figure out the requirements and what was expected of us. | We need to get stuff done earlier. We also need to figure out how to work with only three people now that the fourth as withdrawn. We also need to communicate better if we need or suspect someone else needs help. | We will create issues immediately. We also won't have to spend a lot of time helping somebody who is out of their depth.
**Process** | Apart from John, everybody was able to complete their part with relatively little difficulty. | We need to get some code done and committed as early as possible, even if we're unsure if it's exactly what we're supposed to do. | We will get working code committed as early as possible. We'll also be more careful about testing code before we commit it.
**Tools** | We effectively used Chrome's developer tools to debug the JavaScript portion | We need to write more tests so we can be certain that our code is working as intended. | We'll write more tests, even ones that aren't required.
